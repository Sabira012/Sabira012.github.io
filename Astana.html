<h2> Astana history</h2>
<p>Known as Akmolinsk (Kazakh akmola, “white tomb”) until 1961, Tselinograd (Celinograd) until 1997 Astana was founded in 1830 as a Cossack advanced post. Later a small fortress grew into a town. In 19th century Akmola became an important geopolitical center of the region actually being the center of the whole district.</p>
<p>Astana population reached 33,000 when the town received the status of oblast (region) center in 1939.</p>
<p>Soviet Virgin and Idle Lands Campaign in the mid-1950s (Tselinograd is Russian for Virgin Lands City) and Astana city role as capital of the region that united the five northern oblasts of Kazakhstan in 1960-1965 greatly enhanced its importance.</p>
<p>It led to much new construction and the setting up of various research and higher educational institutions in Astana city. Teacher training, agriculture, medicine, engineering and construction institutes were built in Astana.</p>
<p>In 1992 the city was renamed into Akmola. The word “Akmola” in Kazakh language means “White Grave” or “White Sacred Place”. On May 6th, 1998, by Kazakhstan President’s decree the city Akmola was renamed into Astana.</p>
